# Projects
Project Examples:

- VRP: Here are two assignments. The first one called "Assignment 2 - VRP" was a project where the goal was to use a heuristic and a metaheuristic to solve a VRP problem. The second assingment was to create a Meal Delivery Routing algorithm, based on a heuristic. 
- Genetic Algorithms: This project was a final project in the course Evolutionary Computing. The course's main focus is on evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithm. This was a group project of 5 students. Our goal of the project was to explore the different possibilities of genetic algorithms, seeing how incorporating more diversity and/or different strategies can help to improve results. The report can be found in the file "TheReport.pdf" and the code with comments is the file "MainCode.ipynb".
