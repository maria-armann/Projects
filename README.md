# Projects
Various Programming Projects I have done during my Master's degree. These projects include:

- VRP: The goal of this project was to use a heuristic and a metaheuristic to solve a VRP problem. The metaheuristic is based on a genetic algorithm. 
- Evolutionary Computing: This project was a final project in the course Evolutionary Computing. The course's main focus is on evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithm. This was a group project of 5 students. Our goal of the project was to explore the different possibilities of genetic algorithms, seeing how incorporating more diversity and/or different strategies can help to improve results. 
- Machine Learning: Here are two projects. The first one was in the course Data Mining Techniques. This project involved using Machine Learning to create a recommendation system. The second project was in the course "Machine learning for Quantified Self".
